##Desktop Launcher
On Ubuntu **Linux** systems, you can use the included Desktop Launcher file, `Passphrases.desktop`, to open the program with a double-click. After downloading the repository, copy or move the `Passphrases.desktop` file to your Desktop, then open with a text editor to change the -you the user- component of the path names to your username. Make any other path changes necessary if you do not keep the passphrases-master folder in the default user home directory. Once the paths are set, right click the desktop icon and select Allow Launching, then double-click to execute the `passphrase.py` GUI.
