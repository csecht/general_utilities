### pyPassphrase
A problem with on-line password and passphrase generators is that they are on-line. Here is a generator that can be run locally and privately. The different strings generated are intended to comply with a range of web sites and application password/passphrase requriements. 
Suggestions for improvement are welcome, especially any ideas to implement on Windows.

### pygPassphrase
A GUI implementation of pyPassphrase.

### pyPalindromes
Just something fun. I like the magical way that slice can work to test for and generate palindromes.
