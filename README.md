# general_utilities
Simple Python scripts to make some things easier.

## pyPassphrase
A problem with on-line password and passphrase generators is that they are on-line. Here is a generator that can be run locally and privately. The different strings generated are meant to comply with a range of web sites and application password/passphrase requriements. 
Suggestions for improvement are welcome, especially if it is possible to implement on Widows systems.

## pyPalindromes
Just something fun. I was impressed with the slicing 'trick' to test for and generate palindromes.
